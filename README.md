# ISWI Kitchen Run Wordpress Plugin
A Wordpress plugin that can be used to administrate the famous Kitchen Run game. Currently still in Development.

## Requirements
- Wordpress

## Install
To install it for development purposes you have to download this repository and unzip it into the wp-content/plugins folder. 
Because the plugin uses 3rd party libraries the installation is only complete when they are installed with the composer using following command in the plugin directory.
In the future this should be done automatically when the plugin is installed.

Use the following command:
```bash
php composer.phar install
```
